title: About me
---

I am a third-year Physics and Computer Science undergrad at BITS Pilani, Goa Campus. I am often described as a highly enthusiatic person with an apetite for learning by my friends. I like meeting new people every day. I enjoy good discussions on Physics (science in general), Economics and Society & its evolution (the why of History). I love working on a variety of problems, especially things that require both logic and intuition (maybe that's why I like Physics over maths).

These days, I often find myself exploring my interest in Computational Neuroscience.

Feel free to get in touch!!
